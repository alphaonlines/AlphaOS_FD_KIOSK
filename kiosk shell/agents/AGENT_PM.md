# Agent: PM/Integrator — Project Manager (You + Me)

## Role
Own the project plan, keep deliverables aligned, and integrate components into a working system.

## Scope
- Maintain architecture and schema alignment.
- Track dependencies and unblock engineers.
- Integrate agent + broker/controller + dashboard into a runnable stack.
- Define acceptance tests for end-to-end flow.

## Deliverables
- A consolidated `INTEGRATION.md` with runbook steps.
- A shared schema doc for MQTT payloads and API endpoints.
- Integration checklist and test script (manual ok).

## Expectations
- Weekly checkpoints with Dev 1–3.
- Resolve schema conflicts quickly.
- Keep scope trimmed to MVP.

## Current Focus (Updated)
- Drive an end-to-end smoke test (broker → controller → agent → dashboard).
- Record any schema deviations and update `SCHEMA.md`.
- Verify nightly schedule decisions and update systemd timer as needed.
